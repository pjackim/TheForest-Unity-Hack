# TheForest-Unity-Hack
A Unity Engine cheat for the game The Forest. I made this project to practice programming outside of school, learn C# on my own, and have fun.


If you have The Forest and would like to try my cheat in game, or even make your own using my base, feel free!

  1. If you have made edits, you will need to build your project (Release | x64). Your project will be built to TheForestCheat\bin\x64\Release\Forest\Forest.dll
  
  2. Start The Forest and load into a game. Run TheForestCheat\bin\x64\Release\InjectForest.bat. This will pass your Forest.dll to the Monoinjector and inject it into The Forest.
  
  3. Have fun and learn lots!
